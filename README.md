## ðŸ“– About The Project

We all have that one folder on our computer (usually **Downloads**) that becomes a dumping ground for documents, images, installers, and more. Finding anything in that mess can be a nightmare. This project was created to solve that exact problem.

**Directory Organizer Pro** provides an intuitive interface to select any folder and let the script intelligently sort all the files into neatly organized sub-folders (e.g., `PDF Files`, `JPG Files`, `EXE Files`).  
Itâ€™s a practical tool built to bring order to digital chaos.
